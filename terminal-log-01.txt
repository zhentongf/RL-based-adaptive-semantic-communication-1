Overview

- Replaced the RL-based threshold selection with a fuzzy logic controller that decides transmission mode ( use_nn ) directly from snr_trad_db , distance_m , and rel_speed_ms .
- Added standalone fuzzy logic functions with clear docstrings and smooth trapezoidal/triangular membership functions.
- Integrated fuzzy decision into training and evaluation paths in CIFAR.py .
- Added unit tests covering boundary conditions and an optional performance comparison vs the existing RL agent.
What Changed

- Introduced a new module fuzzy_logic.py providing:
  - membership_snr_db , membership_distance_m , membership_rel_speed_ms
  - evaluate_rules
  - decide_use_nn
- Updated CIFAR.py to use fuzzy decision logic instead of RL:
  - CIFAR.py:33 import replaced with from fuzzy_logic import decide_use_nn
  - Training decision replaced at d:\fzt\github-mine\RL-based-adaptive-semantic-communication-1\CIFAR.py:428 :
    - Old: use_nn = snr < rl_snr_threshold
    - New: use_nn = decide_use_nn(snr_trad_values[snr_idx], distance_values[snr_idx], rel_speed_values[snr_idx])
  - Evaluation decision replaced at CIFAR.py:538 similarly.
  - Save gating replaced at CIFAR.py:579 and CIFAR.py:600 similarly.
  - RL agent initialization, training, reward logic, and summary removed.
Fuzzy Logic Design

- Inputs:
  - snr_trad_db in dB → memberships: low, medium, high
  - distance_m → memberships: near, far
  - rel_speed_ms → memberships: slow, fast
- Memberships use overlapping trapezoidal and triangular functions to ensure smooth transitions and easy tuning:
  - SNR low (0, 0, 15, 25) , medium (18, 28, 38) , high (30, 40, 60, 60)
  - Distance near (0, 0, 20, 50) , far (30, 60, 200, 200)
  - Speed slow (0, 0, 5, 15) , fast (10, 20, 50, 50)
- Rules (min for AND, max for OR):
  - Direct score = AND(high SNR, near distance, slow speed)
  - Semantic score = OR(low SNR, far distance, fast speed)
  - Smoothness: add medium-SNR variants to both sides for gradual behavior
- Crisp decision:
  - use_nn = semantic_score >= direct_score
  - Ties favor semantic per the “low OR far OR fast → semantic” principle.
